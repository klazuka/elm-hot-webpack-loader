# elm-hot-webpack-loader

Hot code swapping support for Elm 0.19. This improves the Elm development workflow by automatically reloading your code in the browser after a change, while preserving your current app state.

This package provides a Webpack loader that can be used in conjunction with [elm-webpack-loader](https://github.com/elm-community/elm-webpack-loader). If you're looking for something that doesn't require Webpack, see [elm-hot](https://github.com/klazuka/elm-hot) (although integrating it will be much more work).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev elm-hot-webpack-loader
```

You will also need to install [elm-webpack-loader](https://github.com/elm-community/elm-webpack-loader), if you haven't already.


## Usage

Assuming that you're already using `elm-webpack-loader`, just add `{ loader: 'elm-hot-webpack-loader' }` immediately 
**before** `elm-webpack-loader` in the `use` array. 

It should look something like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.elm$/,
                exclude: [/elm-stuff/, /node_modules/],

                use: [
                    { loader: 'elm-hot-webpack-loader' },
                    {
                        loader: 'elm-webpack-loader',
                        options: {
                            cwd: __dirname
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

It's important that the `elm-hot-webpack-loader` loader comes *before* the `elm-webpack-loader` in the `use` array.

When running `webpack-dev-server`, you must add the `--hot` flag.

### Caveats

- Elm 0.18 is not supported. Use fluxxu/elm-hot-loader@0.5.x instead.


### Attribution

Elm hot code swapping is based on the work of Flux Xu's [elm-hot-loader](https://github.com/fluxxu/elm-hot-loader). That project is no longer maintained, and it does not support Elm 0.19.
